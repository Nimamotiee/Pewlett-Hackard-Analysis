# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis



### #1 Overview of the Analysis:
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

* Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
* Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
* Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis README.md.



### #2 Results:
* The majority of the retiring eligible workforce derives from the 'Staff Level' Position
* Over 30,000 Staff employees are considered to be potentially retiring soon.
* Just under 30,000 Senior Engineers are considered to be in the RED ZONE in regarde to retirement status therefore management should push to fill positions asap.
* Another 15,000 Engineers are in the same zone therefore PW could be in dire straights in terms of tenured experience in the Engineering sector.

### #3 Summary:
## How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* Around 90k roles across numerous business lines will need to filled in the near term
* I fear the most significant impact will be felt in engineering as many experienced and tenured employees are reaching the end of their careers.

## Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
* There are 1940 retirement ready employees with the ability and criteia to develop the next generation of PW employee.
